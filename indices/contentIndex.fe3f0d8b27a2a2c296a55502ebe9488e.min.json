systems and perspectives of individuals, groups and societies. \n\n## Stages of Spiral Development\n\nFrom earlier stages to later stages:\n- [Beige (Survival

too successful in shaping their environment, it has to deal with the downsides of itself, leading to a chance to grow into the later stage, or collapse and regress to an earlier level of development.\n\nThis is a complex model with take some time to study and appreciate all nuances of it. This breif overview here (or really: nearly any web article) is leaving important parts of the model out.\n\n...\n\n## How do the stages differ?\n\nWith increasing development the following tends to happen:\n- ability to take on more perspectives\n- later stages can understand earlier stages, but not vice versa\n- stages shift from me-entered to we-centered and back\n- increasing circle of concern (my tribe, my nation, entire globe)\n- greater ability to introspect\n- ...\n\nPeople are a mixture of different stages in different areas of their life and in different contexts. When we're speaking of someone being at a stage their general center of gravity lies roughly on that stage.","lastmodified":"2024-05-09T11:03:16.991855449Z","tags":null},"/notes/spiral-dynamics-beige":{"title":"Stage Beige","content":"\n## Core Values\n\n...\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-05-09T11:03:16.987855435Z","tags":null},"/notes/spiral-dynamics-blue":{"title":"Stage Blue","content":"\n## Core Values\n\n...\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-05-09T11:03:16.987855435Z","tags":null},"/notes/spiral-dynamics-green":{"title":"Stage Green","content":"\n## Core Values\n\n...\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-05-09T11:03:16.991855449Z","tags":null},"/notes/spiral-dynamics-orange":{"title":"Stage Orange","content":"\n## Core Values\n\n...\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-05-09T11:03:16.991855449Z","tags":null},"/notes/spiral-dynamics-purple":{"title":"Stage Purple","content":"\n## Core Values\n\n...\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-05-09T11:03:16.991855449Z","tags":null},"/notes/spiral-dynamics-red":{"title":"Stage Red","content":"\n## Core Values\n\n...\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-05-09T11:03:16.991855449Z","tags":null},"/notes/spiral-dynamics-turquoise":{"title":"Stage Turquoise","content":"\n## Core Values\n\n...\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-05-09T11:03:16.991855449Z","tags":null},"/notes/spiral-dynamics-yellow":{"title":"Stage Yellow","content":"\n## Core Values\n\n...\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-05-09T11:03:16.991855449Z","tags":null},"/notes/synectic":{"title":"Synectic","content":"Synektik\nSynactics?","lastmodified":"2024-05-09T11:03:16.991855449Z","tags":null},"/notes/tetralemma":{"title":"Tetralemma","content":"\u003e [!info]\n\u003e This article is part of a series on Coaching Methods.\n\u003e » [Overview of Coaching Methods](notes/coaching-methods-interventions.md)\n\n…","lastmodified":"2024-05-09T11:03:16.991855449Z","tags":null},"/notes/the-work":{"title":"The Work","content":"\u003e [!info]\n\u003e This article is part of a series on Coaching Methods.\n\u003e » [Overview of Coaching Methods](notes/coaching-methods-interventions.md)\n\nPartly adopted as a coaching method for questioning beliefs.
