Spiral Dynamics is a map of the developmental stages, value systems and perspectives of individuals, groups and societies. 

## Stages of Spiral Development

From earlier stages to later stages:

There can be healthier and unhealthier manifestations of a stage, When a stage becomes too successful in shaping their environment, it has to deal with the downsides of itself, leading to a chance to grow into the later stage, or collapse and regress to an earlier level of development.

This is a complex model with take some time to study and appreciate all nuances of it. This breif overview here (or really: nearly any web article) is leaving important parts of the model out.

## How do the stages differ?

With increasing development the following tends to happen:
- ability to take on more perspectives
- later stages can understand earlier stages, but not vice versa
- stages shift from me-entered to we-centered and back
- increasing circle of concern (my tribe, my nation, entire globe)
- greater ability to introspect
- ...

People are a mixture of different stages in different areas of their life and in different contexts. When we're speaking of someone being at a stage their general center of gravity lies roughly on that stage.
