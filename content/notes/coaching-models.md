Coaching models help the coach to structure coaching conversations, and also serve as a tool to communicate to the client:
- how and why coaching works and what they'll be doing during coaching.
- expertise of the coach - especially when they themselves have developed a fairly good coaching model - although it's no guarantee for great coaching

Here are some examples of common coaching models:
* [GROW](notes/grow-model.md)
* ORACLE
* Leadership Choices
* [Inner Game Model](notes/inner-game-model.md)
* Transformational Thresholds Model (»(Transformation-)Schwellenmodell«)
* ...

The best models are built upon profound insights - wether they are stated explicitly or not within the model. Yet they also have to be simple enough to be useful and communicable and not overwhelm with unstructured complexity.


Models also serve as a structuring for the timing and use of specific [interventions and coaching methods](notes/coaching-methods-interventions.md).
