Coaching models help the coach to structure coaching conversations, and also serve as a tool to communicate to the client:
- how and why coaching works and what they'll be doing during coaching.
- expertise of the coach - especially when they themselves have developed a fairly good coaching model - although it's no guarantee for great coaching

Here are some examples of common coaching models:
* GROW
* ORACLE
* Leadership Choices
* [Inner Game Model](notes/inner-game-model.md)
* Transformational Thresholds Model (»(Transformation-)Schwellenmodell«)
* ...

The best models are built upon profound insights - wether they are stated explicitly or not within the model. Yet they also have to be simple enough to be useful and communicable and not overwhelm with unstructured complexity.
