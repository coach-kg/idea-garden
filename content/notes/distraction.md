Distractions are defined relative to where we would need to place our attention and focus in order to fulfill our needs and get a certain result we want.
The worst distractions are those we think are necessary, we can't live without and aren't leading us to where we're set on going. Even worse when they are actually mixed up with what we actually need for going or being where we want to be.
Distractions are attention/time/energy sinks.

Keep in mind distraction is a relative notion. What is a distraction for you one moment in life in a certain measure, might not be at another. It's a question of balance, as anything can turn into too much of a good thing.

Common attention sinks, nowadays:
- entertainment, modern communication technology, social media, the internet
- what else?

Modern tech and media, especially ability to be connected to it all of our waking hours, interact with it as quickly as you can pull out your phone.

And please, don't turn it into "a universal human need" - like in it's a "human need to be served small simple bits of information" ...
