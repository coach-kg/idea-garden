The Inner Game model was developed and popularized by Timothy Gallway with his book "The Inner Game of Tennis". He makes a case for self-talk and self-image separating the poor players from the great. "Inner Game" is the most critical factor in what we commonly notice as top performance and success (or "Outer Game"). Inner Game determines wether you stay in touch with your potential and grow or fool yourself into believing your pettiness.

Make this distinction:
- Inner Game
- Outer Game

Improve or fix your Inner Game before you expect your Outer Game to go well. Success starts on the inside.
